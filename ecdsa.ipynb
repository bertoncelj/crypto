    "### The Downside\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not all roses in the world of elliptic curves; there have been some questions and uncertainties that have held them back from being fully embraced by everyone in the industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "One point that has been in the news recently is the Dual Elliptic Curve Deterministic Random Bit Generator [Dual_EC_DRBG](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-the-nsa-may-have-put-a-backdoor-in-rsas-cryptography-a-technical-primer). This is a random number generator standardized by the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)**, and promoted by the NSA. **Dual_EC_DRBG** generates random-looking numbers using the mathematics of elliptic curves. The algorithm itself involves taking points on a curve and repeatedly performing an elliptic curve \"dot\" operation. After publication, it was reported that it could have been designed with a backdoor, meaning that the sequence of numbers returned could be fully predicted by someone with the right secret number. Recently, the company RSA recalled several of their products because this random number generator was set as the default PRNG for their line of security products. Whether or not this random number generator was written with a backdoor does not change the strength of the elliptic curve technology itself, but it does raise questions about the standardization process for elliptic curves. As we've written about before, it's also part of the reason that attention should be spent ensuring that your system is using adequately random numbers. In a future blog post, we will go into how a backdoor could be snuck into the specification of this algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the more skeptical cryptographers in the world now have a general distrust for NIST itself and the standards it has published that were supported by the NSA. Almost all of the widely implemented elliptic curves fall into this category. There are no known attacks on these special curves, chosen for their efficient arithmetic; however, bad curves do exist, and some feel it is better to be safe than sorry. There has been progress in developing curves with efficient arithmetic outside of **NIST**, including **curve 25519** created by Daniel Bernstein (djb) and more recently computed curves by Paulo Baretto and collaborators, though widespread adoption of these curves are several years away. Until these non-traditional curves are implemented by browsers, they won't be able to be used for securing cryptographic transport on the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another uncertainty about elliptic curve cryptography is related to patents. There are over **130 patents** that cover specific uses of elliptic curves owned by BlackBerry (through their 2009 acquisition of Certicom). Many of these patents were licensed for use by private organizations and even the NSA. This has given some developers pause over whether their implementations of ECC infringe upon this patent portfolio. In 2007, Certicom filed suit against Sony for some uses of elliptic curves; however, that lawsuit was dismissed in 2009. There are now many implementations of elliptic curve cryptography that are thought to not infringe upon these patents and are in wide use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ECDSA digital signature has a drawback compared to RSA in that it requires a good source of entropy. Without proper randomness, the private key could be revealed. A flaw in the random number generator on Android allowed hackers to find the ECDSA private key used to protect the bitcoin wallets of several people in early 2013. Sony's Playstation implementation of ECDSA had a similar vulnerability. A good source of random numbers is needed on the machine making the signatures. Dual_EC_DRBG is not recommended.\n"
