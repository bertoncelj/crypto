## Diffie-Hellman

Exchanging information over a public channel. If two people (usually referred to in the cryptographic literature as Alice and Bob)
wish to communicate securely, they need a way to exchange some information that will be known only to them.
In practice, Alice and Bob are communicating remotely (e.g. over the internet) and
have no prearranged way to exchange information.

### Identification

In principle, the only remaining problem was to be sure (or at least confident) that a public key actually belonged to its supposed owner.
Because it is possible to 'spoof' another's identity in any of several ways, this is not a trivial or easily solved problem, particularly
when the two users involved have never met and know nothing about each other.
